## Prompt Refiner Prompt
ChatGPT, I would like to request your assistance in creating an AI-powered prompt rewriter, which can help me rewrite and refine prompts that I intend to use with you, ChatGPT, for the purpose of obtaining improved responses. To achieve this, I kindly ask you to follow the guidelines and techniques described below in order to ensure the rephrased prompts are more specific, contextual, and easier for you to understand. Additionally, please ask any relevant clarifying questions to ensure you have all the necessary information to produce the best possible rewritten prompt.


Identify the main subject and objective
Examine the original prompt and identify its primary subject and intended goal. Make sure the rewritten prompt maintains this focus while providing additional clarity.


Ask clarifying questions (when necessary)
If you find any part of the original prompt unclear, ambiguous, or lacking relevant context, ask specific, open-ended clarifying questions to gather more information. Use the responses to refine your understanding of the prompt before you finalize your rewritten version. The questions should have 4 possible answer choices.


Add context
Enhance the original prompt with relevant background information, historical context, or specific examples, making it easier to comprehend the subject matter and provide more accurate responses.


Ensure specificity
Rewrite the prompt in a way that narrows down the topic or question, so it becomes more precise and targeted. This may involve specifying a particular time frame, location, or a set of conditions that apply to the subject matter.


Use clear and concise language
Make sure the rewritten prompt uses simple, unambiguous language to convey the message, avoiding jargon or overly complex vocabulary. This will help you better understand the prompt and deliver more accurate responses.


Incorporate open-ended questions
If the original prompt contains a yes/no question or a query that may lead to a limited response, consider rephrasing it into an open-ended question that encourages a more comprehensive and informative answer.


Avoid leading questions
Ensure that the rewritten prompt does not contain any biases or assumptions that may influence your response. Instead, present the question in a neutral manner to allow for a more objective and balanced answer.


Provide instructions when necessary
If the desired output requires a specific format, style, or structure, include clear and concise instructions within the rewritten prompt to guide you in generating the response accordingly.


Ensure the prompt length is appropriate
While rewriting, make sure the prompt is neither too short nor too long. A well-crafted prompt should be long enough to provide sufficient context and clarity, yet concise enough to prevent confusion or loss of focus.


With these guidelines in mind, I would like you to transform yourself into a “prompt rewriter,” capable of refining and enhancing any given prompt to ensure it elicits the most accurate, relevant, and comprehensive responses when used with ChatGPT.


Please begin by examining the original prompt.
If you need more information, ask clarifying questions.
Once all ambiguities are resolved, provide your rewritten version of the prompt based on the instructions above.
Finally, illustrate how your approach fulfills each of the guidelines you followed.


Here is the prompt **topic prompt**






## Topic Prompt
I want to create a structured curriculum for learning [TASK OR SKILL] from the ground up. Break the learning process into logical stages, each containing essential subtopics, concepts, or skills that must be mastered.


For each stage, provide:


A brief description of what is covered.
The key subtopics or skills within that stage.
Any prerequisites (if applicable).
The estimated time or effort needed for completion.
Recommended learning methods (e.g., hands-on projects, reading, exercises).
Ensure the curriculum flows logically from beginner to advanced levels, gradually increasing in difficulty. If applicable, include practical applications and milestone projects at each stage.


Output the curriculum as a structured, numbered list, with each stage labeled and well-defined. Format it clearly for easy reference.
